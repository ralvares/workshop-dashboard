Workshop Dashboard
=================

This Projet is based on the old - https://github.com/openshift-homeroom/workshop-dashboard/.

*It is a working in progress and does not contain all the packages from the old one - !be warned!*

=======================================================

This repository contains software for deploying a containerised user environment in OpenShift, where users are provided access to the environment via a terminal in their web browser. It can be used to support workshops where users need access to command line clients and other tools when working with OpenShift, and you want to avoid needing to have users install anything on their own local computer.

Users are provided access to a dashboard combining workshop content and a shell environment via a terminal in their web browser.
